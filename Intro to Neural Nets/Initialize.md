With the input layer to the first hidden as example, we get y weights for the number of nodes in previous layer, and get x number of them  (columns) for each  (x number) of nodes in next layer (first hidden layer) input layer to first hidden as example, get y weights for the number of nodes in previous layer, and have x number of them for each of those for each (x number) of nodes in next layer (first hidden layer)
